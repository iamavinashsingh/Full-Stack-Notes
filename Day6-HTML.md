Short Notes: How the Internet Works
1. The Core Problem & Solution
Problem: Getting information from one computer to another that isn't in the same room.

Primitive Solution: Physically carrying data (e.g., a USB stick). Slow and doesn't scale.

Digital Solution: Connect them with a cable and send signals (1s and 0s).

2. Scaling to Many Computers (The Local Network)
Problem: Connecting every computer directly to every other is a cable nightmare.

Solution: A Switch (the network's "Conference Call Operator"). Every computer connects to it. The operator efficiently routes messages to the correct recipient within the local office/home.

3. Connecting Many Networks (The Internet)
Problem: How does one office's network talk to another's?

Solution: A Router (the "Post Office Sorting Facility"). It connects networks. Its job is to look at a message's address and decide which path (or "hop") to send it down next to get it closer to its final destination.

The Internet is a "network of networks" connected by routers.

4. Finding Anyone: IP Addresses
Problem: With millions of networks, how do you find one specific device?

Solution: The IP Address (Internet Protocol Address). It's a device's unique "Street Address" on the internet (e.g., 142.250.184.142).

Public IP: Your router's public address. Like your company's main phone number. Unique worldwide.

Private IP: A device's address on your local network (e.g., 192.168.1.10). Like an employee's extension number. Only unique within your "office."

5. Reliable Delivery: Packets & Protocols
Problem: Sending a huge file all at once is slow, monopolizes the connection, and is error-prone.

Solution: TCP/IP (The Internet's "Rules of the Road").

Data is broken into small Packets (like sending a book page-by-page in separate envelopes).

Each packet has the destination IP, sender IP, and a sequence number.

Packets can take different routes. The receiving device reassembles them in order. If a page is missing, it asks for it again.

Key Components Explained with Analogies
IPv4 vs. IPv6
IPv4: The classic format (172.217.16.142). It's like the original phone system with a limited number of possible numbers. We are running out.

IPv6: The new, massive format (2001:0db8:85a3::). It's like adding millions of new area codesâ€”so vast we will never run out of addresses.

MAC Address
A permanent, unique serial number burned into your device's network hardware.

It's your device's fingerprint or DNA. It doesn't change and identifies the physical device itself on a local network.

Format: 3C:22:FB:A3:B4:C5

Port Number
Once data arrives at a device (using its IP address), the port number tells it which application to go to.

It's like the apartment number or suite number in a large office building (the IP address).

Common Ports:

80 (HTTP): Standard web traffic.

443 (HTTPS): Secure web traffic (banks, email, etc.).

3000: The default "apartment" for many Node.js/React development servers.

27017: The default "apartment" for MongoDB databases.

DNS (Domain Name System)
The Internet's Phonebook.

You type a friendly domain name (google.com) into your browser. Your computer asks DNS servers to look up the phone number (IP address) for that name so it can connect.

The Lookup Process is hierarchical: It first asks the root directory, then the .com directory, and finally Google's own directory to get the correct IP. This result is then cached (remembered) for a while for faster future access.
