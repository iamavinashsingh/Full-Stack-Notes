## 💡 Project 3 : Income Tax Calculator

### 🎯 Goal: Let users enter their income and calculate the tax they need to pay.

### 1️⃣ Create an HTML page

- Make a simple webpage.
- Add a form with:
- - An input field for the user to enter their income.
- - A submit button labeled “Calculate Tax”.
- - A result area (like a `<p>` or `<div>`) to display the tax amount.

### 2️⃣ Style with CSS

- Make the form and input fields neat and centered.
- Add padding, margin, and borders to input and button.
- Style the result area so that the tax result is clearly visible.

### 3️⃣ Write JavaScript Logic

- Select the form using document.getElementById or querySelector.
- Add an event listener for submit.
- Inside the event function:
- - Use e.preventDefault() to stop the form from refreshing the page.
- - Get the income value from the input.
- -  Use if-else conditions to calculate the tax based on the slabs:
```
| Income Slab         | Tax Rate |
|---------------------|----------|
| Up to ₹12 lakh      | 0%       |
| ₹12–16 lakh         | 15%      |
| ₹16–20 lakh         | 20%      |
| ₹20–24 lakh         | 25%      |
| Above ₹24 lakh      | 30%      |
```
- Display the calculated tax in the result area.
- Use form.reset() at the end to clear the input field after calculation.

## 💡 Project 4 : Digital Clock

### 🎯 Goal: Create a live digital clock that updates every second using JavaScript.

### 1️⃣ Create an HTML page

- Make a simple webpage.
- Add a heading (h1 or div) where the current time will be displayed.
- You can also add some text like “Current Time:” before the clock.

### 2️⃣ Style with CSS

- Center the clock on the page.
- Make the font bigger and bold so it looks like a real digital clock.
- Add some background color or padding for better appearance.

### 3️⃣ Write JavaScript Logic

- Select the element where the time will be displayed.
- Create a function that:
- - Uses new Date() to get the current date and time.
- -  Uses date.toLocaleTimeString() to format the time in hours:minutes:seconds.
- - Updates the inner text of the clock element with this time.
- - Use setInterval() to call this function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) so the time keeps updating automatically.
