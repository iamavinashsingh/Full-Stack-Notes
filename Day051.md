## üí° Project 3 : Income Tax Calculator

### üéØ Goal: Let users enter their income and calculate the tax they need to pay.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an HTML page

- Make a simple webpage.
- Add a form with:
- - An input field for the user to enter their income.
- - A submit button labeled ‚ÄúCalculate Tax‚Äù.
- - A result area (like a <p> or <div>) to display the tax amount.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Style with CSS

- Make the form and input fields neat and centered.
- Add padding, margin, and borders to input and button.
- Style the result area so that the tax result is clearly visible.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Write JavaScript Logic

- Select the form using document.getElementById or querySelector.
- Add an event listener for submit.
- Inside the event function:
- - Use e.preventDefault() to stop the form from refreshing the page.
- - Get the income value from the input.
- -  Use if-else conditions to calculate the tax based on the slabs:
```
| Income Slab         | Tax Rate |
|---------------------|----------|
| Up to ‚Çπ12 lakh      | 0%       |
| ‚Çπ12‚Äì16 lakh         | 15%      |
| ‚Çπ16‚Äì20 lakh         | 20%      |
| ‚Çπ20‚Äì24 lakh         | 25%      |
| Above ‚Çπ24 lakh      | 30%      |
```
- Display the calculated tax in the result area.
- Use form.reset() at the end to clear the input field after calculation.
