## üåê Part 1: HTML - The Structure

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic skeleton for all web pages.

### How the Internet Delivers HTML
* **Networks & Routers:** Your computer is on a local network. **Routers** act like a postal service, passing data packets between networks to get them to their destination.
* **IP Addresses & DNS:** Every device has a unique **IP address** (like a home address). The **DNS** (Domain Name System) is the internet's phonebook, translating easy-to-remember domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses.

### Core HTML Tags
* **Basic Structure:** Every HTML file has `<html>`, `<head>` (for metadata like the title), and `<body>` (for all visible content).
* **Text:** Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings and `<p>` for paragraphs.
* **Lists:** `<ol>` for **o**rdered (numbered) lists and `<ul>` for **u**nordered (bulleted) lists. Each item uses `<li>`.
* **Links:** The `<a>` (anchor) tag creates links. The destination is set in the `href` attribute: `<a href="https://google.com">Go to Google</a>`.
* **Images:** The `<img>` tag shows images. **Always include `alt` text** for accessibility: `<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A photo of my cat">`.
* **Forms:** The `<form>` tag is used to collect user input with elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.

## üé® Part 2: CSS - The Style

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML, controlling colors, fonts, layout, and more.

### CSS Fundamentals
* **Adding CSS:** The best way is using an **external stylesheet**, linked in the `<head>`: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`.
* **Syntax:** It's a set of rules: `selector { property: value; }`.
    * **Selector:** *Who* to style (e.g., `p`, `.main-content`, `#header`).
    * **Property:** *What* to style (e.g., `color`, `font-size`).
    * **Value:** *How* to style it (e.g., `red`, `16px`).
* **The Cascade (Priority):** Styles are applied in a specific order. The most specific selector wins. **ID (`#header`) > Class (`.warning`) > Element (`p`)**.

### The Box Model üì¶
Everything in CSS is a box with four layers:
1.  **Content:** The text or image itself.
2.  **Padding:** The transparent space *inside* the border, between the content and the edge.
3.  **Border:** The line around the padding.
4.  **Margin:** The transparent space *outside* the border, pushing other elements away.
**Golden Rule:** Always add `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` to the top of your CSS to make layouts more predictable.

### Layouts
* **Display Property:**
    * `block`: Takes up the full width and starts on a new line (like `<div>`, `<p>`).
    * `inline`: Flows with the text and only takes up as much width as it needs (like `<span>`, `<a>`).
* **Flexbox (1D Layout):** Perfect for arranging items in a single row or column. It makes aligning content (like vertical centering) easy.
    * On the container, set `display: flex;`.
    * Use `justify-content` (for main axis spacing) and `align-items` (for cross axis alignment).
* **Grid (2D Layout):** The most powerful tool for creating complex, two-dimensional layouts with both rows and columns.
* **Positioning:**
    * `relative`: Lets you nudge an element from its normal position.
    * `absolute`: Takes an element out of the normal flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
    * `fixed`: Glues an element to the screen, even when you scroll.

### Responsive Design & Effects
* **Media Queries:** Apply different CSS rules based on screen size. This is the key to making your site look good on both mobile and desktop.
    `@media (min-width: 768px) { /* Styles for tablets and up */ }`
* **Transitions:** Make style changes smooth instead of instant. Put the `transition` property on the base element, not the `:hover` state.
* **Transforms:** Move (`translate`), resize (`scale`), and rotate (`rotate`) elements.
* **Animations:** Create multi-step sequences with `@keyframes` for more complex motion.

## üöÄ Part 3: JavaScript - The Interactivity

JavaScript (JS) brings your website to life, handling user interactions, fetching data, and manipulating the page.

### JS Fundamentals
* **Variables:** Containers for data.
    * `const`: Use for values that **will not change**. This should be your default choice.
    * `let`: Use for values that **will change**.
    * **Avoid `var`**. It's the old, confusing way.
* **Data Types:**
    * **Primitives:** Simple, single values like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
    * **Objects:** Complex collections of data, including `{}` (objects) and `[]` (arrays).
* **Operators & Control Flow:**
    * **Comparison:** **Always use strict equality `===`**, which checks both value and type (`7 === "7"` is false).
    * **Decisions:** Use `if / else if / else` to run code based on conditions.
    * **Loops:** Use `for` or `while` to repeat an action.

### Key Objects & Methods
* **Strings:** Text data. They are **immutable** (cannot be changed). Methods like `.toUpperCase()` return a new, modified string.
* **Numbers & Math:** The `Math` object is a toolbox for `Math.round()`, `Math.random()`, etc.
* **Dates:** The `new Date()` object is used for times and dates. **Watch out: months are 0-indexed!** (`0` is January).

### Arrays: The Super List
Arrays are a special type of object used for ordered lists.
* **Core Concept:** A numbered list where the **first item is at index 0**.
* **Modification:**
    * `.push()` / `.pop()`: Add/remove from the **end** (most common).
    * `.splice()`: The tool to add/remove items from the **middle**.
* **Copying:** The modern way is the **spread operator (`...`)**: `const newArray = [...oldArray];`.
* **Looping:** The easiest way is the `for...of` loop: `for (const item of myArray) { ... }`.
* **Sorting (`.sort()`):**
    * **CRITICAL:** For numbers, you **must** provide a function to sort correctly:
        * Ascending: `numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);`
* **Why a JS Array Isn't "Real":** It's actually a flexible **object**, not a rigid block of memory like in other languages. This is why it can hold mixed data types and have gaps.
