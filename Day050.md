## 💡 Project 1 : Random Quote Generator

### Goal: Display a new inspirational quote every time the user clicks a button.


### 1️⃣ Create an HTML page

Make a simple webpage.
At the top, add a heading (h1).
👉 This will show one default quote — like “Believe in yourself!”

Then, below it, add a button named “Generate Quote”.
When someone clicks this button, the quote will change.

### 2️⃣ Connect JavaScript file

Now, link a JavaScript file to your HTML page.
This file will have the logic (the “brain”) of your project.

### 3️⃣ Make an Array of Quotes

Inside your JavaScript file, create an array (a list) that stores multiple quotes.
For example:

“Dream big and work hard.”

“Never give up.”

“You are stronger than you think.”
You can add as many as you want.

### 4️⃣ Add Event Listener for the Button

Now, tell JavaScript to listen for when someone clicks the “Generate Quote” button.

When that happens —
JavaScript should do something special ✨

### 5️⃣ Use Math.random() to pick a random quote

Every time the button is clicked —
JavaScript will generate a random number using Math.random()
That number will help pick one random quote from your array.

### 6️⃣ Show the Quote on Screen

Finally, JavaScript will replace the text inside your `<h1>` with the new random quote.
So the quote on the screen changes each time you click the button.

## 💡 Project 2 : Background Color Changer
### 🎯 Goal: Create an interactive page where clicking a button changes the background color.

### 1️⃣ Create an HTML page

- Make a simple webpage.
- Add one main div with id="parent".
- Inside this div, create five buttons, each with a name and id —
red, green, blue, yellow, and pink.

- 👉 Example: Buttons will look like small color options that users can click.

### 2️⃣ Style with CSS

-  Use CSS to give your page a nice look 
-  Give the parent div full height & width .
- Center the buttons inside it.
- Add spacing between buttons.
- Use background colors for each button that match their names.
(e.g., the “red” button should look red).

### 3️⃣ Write JavaScript Logic

- Select the parent div using document.getElementById.
- Add an event listener on the parent div (for “click”).
- Inside the event function, get the id of the clicked button → e.target.id.
- Store that id inside a variable called color.
- Then set the background color of the parent div → parent.style.backgroundColor = color;
