## 💡 Project 1 : Random Quote Generator

### Goal: Display a new inspirational quote every time the user clicks a button.


### 1️⃣ Create an HTML page

Make a simple webpage.
At the top, add a heading (h1).
👉 This will show one default quote — like “Believe in yourself!”

Then, below it, add a button named “Generate Quote”.
When someone clicks this button, the quote will change.

### 2️⃣ Connect JavaScript file

Now, link a JavaScript file to your HTML page.
This file will have the logic (the “brain”) of your project.

### 3️⃣ Make an Array of Quotes

Inside your JavaScript file, create an array (a list) that stores multiple quotes.
For example:

“Dream big and work hard.”

“Never give up.”

“You are stronger than you think.”
You can add as many as you want.

### 4️⃣ Add Event Listener for the Button

Now, tell JavaScript to listen for when someone clicks the “Generate Quote” button.

When that happens —
JavaScript should do something special ✨

### 5️⃣ Use Math.random() to pick a random quote

Every time the button is clicked —
JavaScript will generate a random number using Math.random()
That number will help pick one random quote from your array.

### 6️⃣ Show the Quote on Screen

Finally, JavaScript will replace the text inside your <h1> with the new random quote.
So the quote on the screen changes each time you click the button. 💬
