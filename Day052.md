# Javascript Projects Basic

## 💡 Project 5 : Interactive Clicker 🎈

### 🎯 Goal: Create a fun interactive effect where bubbles appear and fade away when the user clicks anywhere on the screen.

### 1️⃣ Create an HTML page

- Make a simple webpage —
- You don’t need buttons or forms this time 😄
- Just a plain page where the user can click anywhere, and bubbles will appear.

### 2️⃣ Style with CSS

- You’ll create a bubble effect using CSS animation 
- Each bubble will be a small circle (div) with:
- position: absolute; (so it can appear anywhere on the screen)
- border-radius: 50%; (to make it round)
- A random background color each time.
- Animation idea:
  - From 0% → scale(1), opacity: 1
  - To 100% → scale(3), opacity: 0
💨 This will make the bubble grow bigger and disappear smoothly.

### 3️⃣ Write JavaScript Logic

- Add an event listener for "click" on the whole document.
- When the user clicks:
- Create a new div element.
- Give it a class "bubble".
- Set its position based on the mouse click:
- bubble.style.left = e.clientX + "px";
- bubble.style.top = e.clientY + "px";
- Give it a random color using something like hsl(Math.random()*360, 100%, 50%).
- Append the bubble to the body.
- After the animation finishes (like 5 second), remove the bubble from the page using setTimeout.

##💡 Project 6 : To-Do List 📝

### 🎯 Goal: Create a simple To-Do List app where users can add, view, and remove their daily tasks.

### 1️⃣ Create an HTML page

Make a simple webpage with these elements:

A text input box → to type a new task.
An “Add Task” button → to add it to the list.
An unordered list (<ul>) → to display all the tasks.
👉 Each new task will appear as a list item under the <ul>.

### 2️⃣ Style with CSS

- Make it look clean and organized 😄
- Center the whole list section.
- Add spacing and borders around tasks.
- Style the “Add Task” button nicely.
- You can add hover effects or line-through style for completed tasks later if you want 🎨

### 3️⃣ Write JavaScript Logic

- Select the input, button, and list elements.

- Add an event listener to the “Add Task” button.
- When clicked:
  - Read the value from the input field.
  - Create a new <li> element.
  - Set its text to the entered task.

- Append it to the `<ul>`.
- Clear the input box after adding the task (input.value = "").
- Add another event listener on the <ul> (event delegation).
- When a user clicks on a task (li), remove it from the list or mark it completed.
