### ** Operators & Control Flow**

* **Operators:** Symbols that perform actions.
    * **Assignment:** `=` puts a value in a variable. `+=` does math and assigns (e.g., `x += 5` is `x = x + 5`).
    * **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. The modulo `%` gives the remainder (`10 % 3` is `1`).
    * **Comparison:** `===` is the **Golden Rule**. It checks if both value and type are identical (`7 === "7"` is **false**). Avoid `==`.
    * **Logical:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).

* **Truthy & Falsy:** In conditions, every value acts like `true` or `false`.
    * There are only **6 falsy values**: `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`. Everything else is truthy.

* **Control Flow:**
    * **if-else:** Makes decisions. The first `true` condition runs, and the rest are skipped.
    * **`for` loop:** Use when you know exactly **how many times** to repeat.
    * **`while` loop:** Use when you need to repeat **as long as a condition is true**. (Remember to change the condition to avoid infinite loops!)

### **Lecture 05: Number, Math & String**

* **Numbers:** JavaScript has only one `number` type for both integers and decimals.
    * **Floating-Point Issue:** Decimal math can be imprecise (`0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly `0.3`). For money, work with cents or use `.toFixed(2)` to display rounded values.
    * **`Math` Object:** A toolbox for numbers.
        * `Math.round(4.7)` → `5`
        * `Math.floor(4.9)` → `4` (always rounds down)
        * `Math.ceil(4.1)` → `5` (always rounds up)
        * `Math.random()` → a random number between 0 and 1.

* **Strings:** A sequence of characters.
    * **Golden Rule:** Strings are **immutable**; they cannot be changed. Methods that "modify" them actually return a new string.
    * **Template Literals (\`\`)**: The modern way to build strings. They make it easy to insert variables: `` `Hello, ${name}!` ``.
    * **Key Methods:** `.length`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.slice(start, end)`, `.split(',')`, `.trim()`.

### **Lecture 06: Date**

* **Core Concept:** A `Date` object is a single number representing the milliseconds since Jan 1st, 1970.
* **The #1 Gotcha:** Months are **0-indexed**!
    * `0` = January, `1` = February, ..., `11` = December.
    * `new Date(2025, 0, 15)` is **January** 15, 2025.
* **Real-World Use:** The built-in `Date` object is clumsy. In real projects, developers use libraries like **Day.js** or **date-fns** for easier and safer date handling.

### **Lecture 07: Array in JavaScript**

* **Core Concept:** An array is a numbered, ordered list. The first item is at **index 0**.
* **Creation & Access:** Create with `[]`. Get an item with `myArray[0]`. Get the size with `myArray.length`.

* **Modifying Arrays (Changing the original):**
    * `.push(item)`: Add to the **end**.
    * `.pop()`: Remove from the **end**.
    * `.unshift(item)`: Add to the **start**.
    * `.shift()`: Remove from the **start**.
    * `.splice(start, deleteCount, items...)`: The "surgery" tool. Can add, remove, or replace items anywhere in the middle. **This is the correct way to delete from the middle.**
    * **AVOID `delete`:** Never use `delete myArray[1]`. It leaves an empty "hole" in the array and doesn't change the length.

* **Creating New Arrays (Not changing the original):**
    * `.slice(start, end)`: Copies a piece of the array into a new one.
    * **Spread Operator (`...`)**: The modern way to copy (`[...myArray]`) or combine (`[...arr1, ...arr2]`) arrays.

* **Looping:**
    * **`for...of` loop:** The simple, modern way to loop over each **value** in an array. `for (const item of items) { ... }`

* **Sorting (`.sort()`):**
    * **CRITICAL:** By default, `.sort()` treats numbers like strings, which gives the wrong result (`[1, 10, 2]` becomes `[1, 10, 2]`).
    * **To sort numbers correctly, you MUST provide a compare function:**
        * **Ascending:** `numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);`
        * **Descending:** `numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);`

### **Why a JS `Array` is Not a "Real" Array**

* **A "Real" Array (like in C++):** Is a fixed block of memory where all items are the same type. This is very rigid but extremely fast.
* **A JavaScript `Array`:** Is actually a special **object**.
    * The indexes (`0`, `1`, `2`) are just property keys.
    * This is why JS arrays can hold different data types (`[1, "hello", true]`) and have empty gaps (`myArray[1000] = 'a'`), which a real array cannot do.
    * Though it's an object, modern JavaScript engines are highly optimized to make it act very fast when you use it like a normal, dense list.
