# 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type
There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

 

Example 1:

Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.
Example 2:

Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.
Example 3:

Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.
 

Constraints:

1 <= text.length <= 104
0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26
text consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
brokenLetters consists of distinct lowercase English letters.

Today’s LeetCode POTD: Maximum Words You Can Type ⌨️
We’re given:

A text string with words separated by spaces

A set of broken keyboard letters

👉 Need to find: how many words can still be fully typed?

2/
🔹 Example:
text = "hello world"
broken = "ad"

"hello" ✅ (no a or d)

"world" ❌ (has d)

Answer = 1 word you can type.

3/
The trick here:

For each word → check if it contains any broken letter

If yes → skip ❌

If no → count it ✅

That’s it — very straightforward string checking!

4/
Key insight:
👉 Every broken letter invalidates a whole word.
👉 No need to build or modify strings — just check presence efficiently.

5/
This problem teaches:

String traversal & word splitting

Efficient checking with sets/loops

Real-world application (broken keyboard 😅)

Have you tried this one yet? How would you optimize it?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canBeTypedWords(string text, string brokenLetters) {
        int count = 0;
        istringstream iss(text);
        string word;
        while (iss >> word) {
            bool canType = true;
            for (char c : brokenLetters) {
                if (word.find(c) != string::npos) {
                    canType = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (canType) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
